**This directory contains scripts explaining different techniques and methods that were tested during my research.**\
**All of the files here are present directly in the Report.pdf from docs directory.**

###Code arallelization:\
try.sh -> shell script for running on the cluster (page: 10)\
try1.py -> function of one argument, one return value (page: 10)\
try2.py -> function of one argument, two return values (page: 12)\
try3.py -> function of two arguments, one return value (page: 14)\
try4.py -> function of two arguments, two return values (page: 15)\
try5.py -> inefficient usage of memory in code parallelization (page: 17)\
try6.py -> efficient usage of shared memory in code parallelization (page: 19)\
